# About

Program Comics is a place to review or learn programming concepts visually, often through a sequence of annotated images.
The name "Program Comics" also refers to how these comics are entirely programmed, including the diagrams which are made using [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim).
The idea of comics as a medium that can convey any content, not just superheroes and fantasy, came from the book [Understanding Comics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding_Comics).
