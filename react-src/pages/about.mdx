# About

Program Comics is a place to review or learn programming concepts visually, often through a sequence of annotated images.
The name "Program Comics" also refers to how these comics are entirely programmed, including the diagrams which are made using [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim).

## Design

- **Concepts and Categories:** Concepts are placed into a single category, like Dijkstra’s in Graph Algorithms.
- **Two Pages for each Concept:** Each concept has two pages, one for _review_ and one for _learning_.
  A tarpit I almost got stuck in was trying to serve two audiences at once: the completely new learner and the familiar reviewer.
  In practice, the new learner should be actively engaged and feel some personality in the writing.
  The reviewer often wants clarity and concept compression (think: chess experts and their [Chunking](https://www.notion.so/d58705114028435183206d2a83a0fe7a?pvs=21)).
  If the reviewer wants verbal detail, then they have wikipedia.
- **Behavioral or Conceptual Explanations:** A page has one or more "smaller explanations." An important distinction is behavioral versus conceptual explanations.
  A behavioral explanation shows what the program does in individual steps, like in [Python Tutor](https://pythontutor.com/).
  A conceptual explanation shows the concept at different angles, integrates this concept with adjacent concepts, and most importantly covers the concept’s essence.
  Slideshows are often used for behavioral explanations, while comics or plain markdown are used for conceptual explanations. For simple concepts like insertion sort, the behavioral and conceptual distinction isn’t very important.
- **Dynamic Content:** A program for an algorithm like Dijkstra's can be rerun on different inputs to get varied visual explanations. In contrast, a powerpoint presentation of an algorithm must be manually recreated for a different input.
