## Welcome to this demo comic webpage!

This comic webpage aims to explain how program comics and comic webpages like this one are created. You can view the source code for this file at `pages/demo.mdx`.
It contains markdown, written directly in the file, and react components, imported from elsewhere in the codebase. Here's an example of a React component that uses a custom comic font and a column layout:

<Row
  comps={[
    <Text
      value={
        <span>
          the quick{" "}
          {<Text value="brown" color="brown" fontSize={"30px"} inline={true} />}{" "}
          fox jumps over the{" "}
          {<Text value="lazy" color="blue" italics={true} inline={true} />} dog.
        </span>
      }
    />,
    <Text
      value="This is the second column, which is just a Text Component inside a Row Component."
      pos={LEFT}
    />,
  ]}
/>
<span>
  There are five elements used to construct a comic: `Text`, `Image`, `Panel`,
  `Row`, and `Column`. A comic is just a sequence of annotated pictures -- a
  `Row` or a `Column`. These comics are not nearly as expressive as standard
  comics but they serve our purposes. Let's see an example in action:
</span>

<ComicComponents />

Each element is a react component and offers parameters for customizing styling and layout.
The goal of these components is to make it easy to write simple program comics, without having to touch any CSS or HTML.

It helps to know a few constraints and the grammar of the program comic language.
The language of a standard program comic is defined by a pretty simple
grammar:

- `Panel -> Text (Above) Panel | Text (Below) Panel | Image | Text`
- `Row -> Text (Above) Row | Text (Below) Row | Panel | Panel + Row`
- `Col -> Text (Above) Col | Text (Below) Col | Panel | Panel + Col`

Elements in a Row will have the same height.
Elements in a Column will have the same width.
Following these constraints, all elements will expand to fit the space they need.

In practice, `Row`s and `Col`s are not recursively defined and instead accept a parameter that represents a list of components.
Let's see another example and call attention to the styling and layout parameters:

<DemoComic />

Below is the code that creates the comic above. Yes I know I need a custom code block.

<span style={{ fontSize: "16px" }}>
  ```
  <Row
    text={<Text value="Styling and Layout" color={RED} fontSize="24px" />}
    comps={[
      <Row
        text={
          <Text
            value="Select a group of panels and annotate them. You can choose whether to have an outline or not."
            pos={CENTER}
            align={CENTER}
          />
        }
        comps={[
          <Panel panel={<img src="/graphics/demo/car-stop-sign1.png" />} />,
          <Panel panel={<img src="/graphics/demo/car-stop-sign2.png" />} />,
        ]}
      />,
      <Row
        comps={[
          <Panel
            text={
              <Text
                value="You can choose the text position, alignment, color, and font size."
                color={RED_E}
                fontSize="16px"
                align={RIGHT}
              />
            }
            useOutline={true}
            panel={<img src="/graphics/demo/car-stop-sign1.png" />}
          />,
          <Panel
            text={
              <Text
                fontSize="14px"
                value="And it's position! It looks funny, but remember that the goal is to conform to a grid"
              />
            }
            posText={DOWN}
            useOutline={true}
            panel={<img src="/graphics/demo/car-stop-sign2.png" />}
          />,
        ]}
      />,
    ]}
  />
  ```
</span>

You can create slideshows too:

<span>
  ```
  <Slideshow folder="/graphics/demo/slideshow" size={2} />
  ```
</span>

<Slideshow folder="/graphics/demo/slideshow" size={2} />

These aren't really comics but they're useful when teaching programming. Note that
the files in the slideshow folder must be named `step0.png`, `step1.png`, and so
on.

The actual images in the comic can be created using [manim](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim), which is a version of the python library that 3blue1brown uses for math animation videos.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
