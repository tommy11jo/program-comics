# Concepts and Proof

Coming soon! Maybe.
{/* Scratch Notes: Runtime breakdown. Negative edges. Connection to BFS. Proof. Interesting problem with needing shortest path to reach N points in any order and then come back. Find shortest path between all pairs of N points. Those are now edges. Duplicate source. Then find shortest path on new graph from source to duplicate source. */}
