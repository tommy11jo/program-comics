Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest paths between a source
vertex and all other vertices in a graph with nonnegative weights. (Show picture and the previous sentence description in row layout.)

ðŸŒŸ Recommendation: As you go through the slideshow, try to predict what will happen on the next slide before you view it. There's also a second slideshow with a different graph for extra practice. Then, try to implement it yourself before you see the code below.

<Slideshow folder="/graphics/dijkstra/slideshow" size={16} />

<Row
  comps={[
    <Text
      value={
        <div>
          the big {<Text value="red" color="red" inline={true} />} dog jumped
        </div>
      }
      buff={1}
      align={LEFT}
    />,
    <Text
      value="Explore the start. The minimum distance from the start to start is 0. Explore the start. The minimum distance from the start to start is 0."
      buff={1}
      align={RIGHT}
