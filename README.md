# program-comics

[Program Comics](https://programcomics.com) is a website for explaining algorithms visually, with an emphasis on showing labeled images in a sequence. Read more on my blog [here](https://www.tomjo.me/program-comics). So far this project is in Demo Status.

The diagrams are programmed using [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim), a math animation library by 3blue1brown. For generating the images above, see this [source code](https://github.com/tommy11jo/program-comics/blob/main/manim-src/dijkstras.py).

I'm also working on creating a variant of manim designed for still pictures, [still-manim](https://github.com/tommy11jo/still-manim), which you can try in the [still-manim web editor](https://still-manim-editor.vercel.app/).
